# Title Caching in YouTube Segment Detection

This document explains the title caching challenge and the implementation of a solution to prevent title conflicts between different YouTube segments.

## The Problem

When detecting multiple YouTube videos in sequence, the title detection system can encounter a significant challenge:

1. When the system finds a YouTube video segment (e.g., Video A), it detects both the ID and title
2. When scanning for the exact boundaries of Video A, it may encounter a different video (Video B)
3. The title of Video B might get cached and incorrectly assigned to Video A
4. This results in incorrect titles being associated with video segments

This issue especially affects:
- Videos that appear in quick succession
- When searching for segment boundaries using binary search
- When checking adjacent frames for segment transitions

## The Solution

We implemented a title caching prevention mechanism with these key features:

1. **Selective Title Caching**: Added a `prevent_title_caching` parameter to the `get_youtube_id_from_frame` function
   ```python
   def get_youtube_id_from_frame(index, cache, prevent_title_caching=False):
   ```

2. **Local vs. Global State**: The function maintains a local title variable that's returned without affecting the global state
   ```python
   # Only update the global last_title if we're not preventing caching
   if not prevent_title_caching:
       last_title = title
   ```

3. **Boundary Detection Protection**: All boundary detection functions now use the flag to prevent title caching
   ```python
   # Prevent title caching during binary search
   check_id, _, _ = get_youtube_id_from_frame(mid, cache, prevent_title_caching=True)
   ```

4. **Next Frame Protection**: When checking for transitions between segments, title caching is prevented
   ```python
   # Prevent title caching when checking the next frame
   next_youtube_id, _, _ = get_youtube_id_from_frame(next_frame, cache, prevent_title_caching=True)
   ```

## Benefits

This approach ensures:

1. **Title Integrity**: Each segment maintains its correct title
2. **Accurate Metadata**: YouTube segments are properly identified with their correct titles
3. **Clean Transitions**: No title contamination between adjacent segments
4. **Proper Attribution**: Preserved titles make it easier to identify and catalog the videos

## Implementation Details

The implementation addresses the title caching issue without modifying the core detection algorithm:

1. **Minimal Interface Change**: Added an optional parameter with a default value to maintain backward compatibility
2. **Explicit Debug Information**: When title caching is prevented, it's clearly logged in debug output
3. **Local Variable Return**: Returns locally determined titles while preserving global state
4. **Strategic Usage**: Applied at key points where title conflicts are most likely to occur

This solution effectively resolves the title confusion that could occur when multiple YouTube videos appear in sequence, improving the overall accuracy of the segment detection system.
